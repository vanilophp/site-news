Product variants in an E-commerce system are unique products that only differ
from each other in a specific way such as size, color, amount of memory, etc.

For example, if you are selling iPhones of different colors, then red, white,
green, and purple are the variants.

Variants can have their own prices, inventory tracking, but most of their
properties are common.

Vanilo 3 has added support for product variants.

Depending on your needs, the product variants can be implemented in several ways.
The Vanilo 3 Documentation contains a detailed guide about what to consider and
how to add product variants support to your E-commerce system.
